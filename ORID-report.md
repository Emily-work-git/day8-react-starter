## ORID Report - Emily
#### Objective: What Did We Learn Today?
Today, we learned about dto, mapper, and FlyWay, a tool for database version control in SpringBoot. We also explored the basics of React, including components and state management. 

#### Reflective: My Feelings
I enjoyed drawing a concept map to summarize and consolidate my understanding of SpringBoot. It was a great opportunity to review what I have learned in the past few days. Additionally, revisiting React basics allowed me to refresh my knowledge and I was pleased to find that I still remembered how to use it.

#### Interpretive: Why?
Throughout the past few days, we have covered a lot of material on SpringBoot. However, we haven't had many chances to connect the different concepts together. Drawing a concept map was an effective way to bridge the gaps and create a cohesive understanding of the subject. Similarly, revisiting React helped me reinforce my foundational knowledge and build confidence in using it.

#### Direction: Action Points - What Changes Will I Make?
Based on today's learnings, I will continue to explore and practice using React components and state management. I will also further investigate FlyWay and its application in SpringBoot projects. By doing so, I aim to deepen my understanding and proficiency in these areas.
